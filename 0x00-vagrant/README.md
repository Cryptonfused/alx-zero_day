# Hello Ubuntu

Welcome to the "0x00-vagrant" directory of the Vagrant project. In this directory, you will find information related to setting up and using your Ubuntu virtual machine (VM) with Vagrant.

## Task 1: Create the Directory and README.md

1. Inside the "zero_day" repository, create a new directory called "0x00-vagrant."

2. Add a `README.md` file to this directory.

## Task 2: SSH into Your Ubuntu VM

To SSH into your Ubuntu VM, follow these steps:

- Make sure your VM is up and running by using the `vagrant up` command.

- Use the `vagrant ssh` command to access the VM.

3. Run the `uname` command without any options. This command prints information about the system. Take note of what it displays.

## Task 3: Document Your Answer

4. Type your answer (the output of `uname` from Task 2) into a file within the "0x00-vagrant" directory.

5. Push this file to your GitHub repository, ensuring it is named accordingly as shown below:
